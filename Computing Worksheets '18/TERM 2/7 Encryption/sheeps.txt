we are sheeps to the cosmic slaughter,
sheeps so blinded by the incoherence, 
and yet everything comes into humbling focus.
why, is every event not a pit stop that 
punctuates our trundle to our ending destination? 
is every passenger on this train not at best meaningful? 
the wool with which we don, 
they are our little comforts,
our strongholds of solitude
thank you
